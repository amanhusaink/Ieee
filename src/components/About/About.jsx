    Established in 2005, IEEE SB AWHEC has been a pioneer in promoting  technical innovation and professional development among students at  AWHEC.
     Our student branch is committed to building a dynamic community  where aspiring engineers can hone their skills,
     delve into advanced  technologies, and contribute to the global IEEE network.
      Over the years,  we have become a center of creativity and collaboration,
       offering  numerous opportunities for students to participate in technical  projects, workshops, and competitions.<br/>
    In 2024, we reached a significant milestone by earning a spot<br/> on the  esteemed IEEE LINK team, reflecting the dedication and hard work of our  members. 
    As we continue to grow, we remain dedicated to equipping our  members with the knowledge,
     skills, and connections necessary to excel<br/>  in their careers and positively impact society.
